				<br>
				<p>
					The increase in our nation's population means that our need for good medical staff is greater than ever. A shortage of nurses equates to patients not being monitored and errors being made.
					<br><br>
					As a response to this, we want to increase the amount of nurses by 50,000 by reintroducing a maintenance grant of between Â£5000-8000 a year. We will focus on quality and retention by also involving foreign recruitment and policies.
