					Hi, Iâ€™m Ruth Chernous and I am a Copywriter. Would you like to create quality content that builds awareness around your organic food range and drives sales to your supermarket?
					<br><br>
					Did you know that one of the biggest challenges that businesses face is the ability to generate leads. Without attracting the right customers, you cannot create a relationship with prospective consumers, generate sales and grow your business. 
					<br><br>
					I have realized that one of the reasons that businesses fail to entice new customers is their inability to create high quality content. Due to our tech driven society, it has become essential to produce content that stands out by being unique and provides good value to customers. 
					<br><br> 
					For a classy look with little effort, wear a pair of leggings with a long white shirt, a blazer and high heeled boots. This can be worn to the office or for dinner with friends.<br><br>
					At the age of 30. Gone are the days of wearing leggings with a short tee.
					<br><br>
					One way of giving away this value is by writing content. As a copywriter I can provide you with advertising features, social media posts, press releases, newsletters and more based on your organic food range. All of which will be specifically targeted to your audience, attract interest and produce sales. 
					<br><br>
					My training in copywriting and my knowledge in generating leads for my own start-up through content marketing means I am well versed in writing content that attracts customers.
					<br><br>
					I started my startup Kushion Doctor 2 weeks ago and so far I have gained 73 followers on Instagram. Most of which engage with my content on a regular basis. Also, my online shop has had 39 visits and 132 views.
					<br><br>
					Therefore, I would like to extend my knowledge to promote your supermarket in order to maximise your sales. To get the ball rolling please email me at <em>chernousruth@gmail.com</em>
