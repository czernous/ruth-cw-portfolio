				<br>
				<p>
					
					What would you do if you had 10 mins to get to an interview for your dream job?<br><br>
					The answer might just surprise you.
					<br><br>
					Invest in a single pair of leggings. It sounds crazy to suggest wearing leggings to an important event.
					<br><br>
					But what if your employers canâ€™t even tell.
					Below are my suggestions for wearing leggings to a formal occasion with very little time spent on styling.
					<br><br>
					<h2 class="modal_subheading">Pair it with a long shirt and blazer.</h2><br>
					People wearing leggings strictly for the gym is a thing of the past.
					<br><br> 
					For a classy look with little effort, wear a pair of leggings with a long white shirt, a blazer and high heeled boots. This can be worn to the office or for dinner with friends.<br><br>
					<h2 class="modal_subheading">Wear it with a duster jacket or a long kimono.</h2><br>
					At the age of 30. Gone are the days of wearing leggings with a short tee.
					<br><br>
					But age has no limits.<br><br>
					You can still look presentable by wearing a kimono or a duster jacket over your leggings. For a balanced look, go for a kimono or jacket with bold colourful prints worn with a pair of black leggings.<br><br>
					<h2 class="modal_subheading">Match it with a dress.</h2><br>
					Printed leggings can also be worn to the office. Wear them under a sundress or an A-line dress. Make sure the dress is knee-length and in neutral colours. For dresses in a bold colour, match it with a monochromatic pair of leggings.
