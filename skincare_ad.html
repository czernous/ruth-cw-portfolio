				<br>
				<p>					 
					Many people make the mistake of buying skin-care products based on either the fragrance or brand. However, this approach is unlikely to get you good results as many high-end brands use cheap ingredients to create their products.
					<br><br>
					When buying a beauty product, you should look for ingredients that have been scientifically proven to enhance, rather than hinder, the process. Such ingredients are Retinol, Sulfur, Salicylic Acid, Witch hazel, Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid.
					<br><br>
					A regular skincare routine can help keep your complexion blooming and keep the blemishes away. This should consist of cleansing, exfoliating and moisturising twice a day.
					<br><br>
					For dry skin use a cleanser made from hyaluronic acid. It will remove oil and dirt. A gentle exfoliant like Clinique Clarifying Lotion 1 will remove dry flakes and fine lines without drying out your skin. 
					<br><br>
					It is important to follow-up with a light moisturiser or a hydrating gel as it will help keep your skin hydrated without that sticky feeling.
					<br><br>
					If you have oily skin, use salicylic acid to cleanse. As it reduces the overproduction of oil and reduces the size of pores. It also removes dead skin cells and reduces discolouration.
					<br><br>
					After, apply an oil-free moisturiser like Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel by Clinique.
					 This will ensure your skin is kept moisturised, soft and balanced. Finishing your routine with a lightweight SPF will protect your skin from UV rays.
					 <br><br>
					Oily skin and dry skin is fairly easy to deal with. But what if you have combination skin?
					<br><br>
					A cream cleanser will moisturise this skin type as-well-as unclog pores and control oil. Follow up with an exfoliant with fruit enzymes. And moisturise using an oil-free moisturiser.
					<br><br>
					Remember, you are not alone when it comes to bad skin. With the right products and routine, you can achieve the perfect skin. <br><br>
